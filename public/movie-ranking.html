<h1>The Best Movies According to Charu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>My very first Tom Hanks movie. Loved the concept and acting and fell in love with Tom Hanks' acting there on.</p>
<h3>Cast Away</h3>
<p>Kept me on the edge of my seat. No one could have done justice to the role except Tom Hanks</p>
<h3>Hera Pheri</h3>
<p>Everytime i watch it, everytime i laugh so hard.. Great comedy of all times.  
    Love the dialogue from Paresh Rawal = "Utha re le baba, utha le !! Mere ko nahi in logon ko utha le."</p>
